# DSC232R_DFMProject
This is my project for my UCSD DSC232R course, being done in the Spring 2025 quarter. This project deals with images of skin lesions and attempts to accurately classify which images contain malignant skin lesions (i.e. melanoma) and which images contain benign skin lesions (i.e. nevus, seborrheic keratosis).
